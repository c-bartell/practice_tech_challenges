# Practice Tech Challenges
---
This repo is a place where I can store any practice technical problems that I have done, or am currently working on, while allowing me to still practice effective Git workflow. Currently, it contains my solutions to challenges from [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) and [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/).

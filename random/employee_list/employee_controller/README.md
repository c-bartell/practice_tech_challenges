# Description
---
Given an `Employee` object that has the attributes `name` (a `String` representation of the employee's name) and `direct_reports` (a list of the `Employee` objects that directly report to that employee), write a function that takes an `Employee` (specifically, the CEO) and returns or prints the names of every employee in the company.
